				<p class="paragraph-properties">A brief description of the signs of the zodiac begins with the fiery Aries. The ruling planets of the sign are Mars and the Sun. Do you want to meet a real madman? Aries is a person with a colossal supply of energy, with a desire to win, to perform feats and impulsive acts. Boredom and routine disgust them, and the world seems black and white. They like to tell the truth in person, they are very stubborn. They attract people with innocence, generosity, masculinity and the ability to take responsibility.</p>

				<p class="paragraph-properties">Taurus opens the earth signs of the zodiac. Its characteristics are as follows: sentimentality, sensuality; the ability to stand firmly on your feet and yield to others. By nature, Taurus is silent, keeps a lot in himself, knows how to think soberly, is intuitive and has powerful willpower. While calm, demonstrates gentleness, patience. If you hit a nerve, it explodes easily. He does not like pressure from outside, he is offended for a long time. Advice is not for Taurus: they know everything themselves. They go to their goal over their heads, showing an imperious and stubborn nature.</p>

				There are dual zodiac signs in the horoscope. The description of Gemini is necessarily built on extremes. They live under the control of Mercury, belong to the air element, therefore they are windy, changeable, but very friendly. Gemini has many advantages: They have a variety of talents. Smart, evolving all the time. Able to get together and make a “quantum leap” in any activity. There are also disadvantages. These include absent-mindedness, unwillingness to take responsibility. Many will consider them hypocrites, but Gemini only confuse themselves, because they cannot choose a clear position in life. They often experience conflicting feelings and get into ridiculous situations.</p>

				<p class="paragraph-properties">What do the signs of the zodiac mean, whose names coincide with the names of animals?

				<p class="paragraph-properties">No wonder the meaning of the signs of the zodiac coincides with their character. Virgo as an earth sign is very realistic, and Mercury makes her a smart materialist. Hardworking and reliable representatives of the sign are endowed with a sober view of things, pedantry. Virgos are prone to system analysis, constantly criticize themselves and others, and try to keep everything under control. They maintain order in money, affairs and the house, they are practical and homely. In relationships, they are shy, very sincere and generous, they know how to sympathize and help people, they are not afraid of responsibility.</p>

				<p class="paragraph-properties">The characteristics of the signs of the zodiac perfectly determine the type of behavior of people. This also applies to Libra. They have many excellent features: prudence and erudition; dreaminess and elegance; ability to learn and love of knowledge. Libras love to be praised, but they can't stand criticism. Rarely show originality, try not to take on too much responsibility. But because of the duality of nature, they can go to extremes: either they work in the sweat of their brow and rush into the midst of noisy companies, or they close in on themselves, give up and fall into melancholy. Libra loves comfort and beauty, not against unwinding in the company of the opposite sex.</p>

				<p class="paragraph-properties">The main characteristic of the zodiac sign Scorpio is inconsistency. It lives under the control of two planets - Mars and Pluto, therefore it is unique. Scorpios can show both eroticism and aggression at the same time. Either to be secretive, silent, or to explode violently in an instant. They defend themselves more often than they attack, they know how to love passionately, but they are not ready to open their hearts to everyone. Scorpios love to live, as they say, to the fullest, they are extremely reckless, prone to addictions, categorical. People are often not trusted and create a tragedy from scratch. Innate intuition made them excellent psychologists and natural manipulators.</p>

				<p class="paragraph-properties">The description of the zodiac sign Sagittarius must necessarily include bright characteristics. Sagittarians live under the control of the planet Jupiter, so they make excellent philosophers, spiritual leaders, and travelers. The main talents of Sagittarius: generosity and cheerfulness; desire to change the world for the better. The representatives of this sign have well-developed willpower, they are decisive and slightly belligerent, they love to teach everyone. At the same time, they always show friendliness, born optimists. Only outright lies, hypocrisy and attempts to subjugate their will can enrage them.</p>

				<p class="paragraph-properties">The earth sign Capricorn is one of the strongest, according to the horoscope. His characteristics include practicality, prudence, a sober view of things. Capricorns know what discipline is, and from Saturn they received angelic patience and a desire to be recognized by other people. This sign knows how to use all the chances in life, is prone to leadership, loves to learn, develop, stand firmly on its feet and go to the goal. Capricorn does not like to take risks, can become an inveterate pessimist and close due to self-doubt. He does not really know how to rest, be lazy and relax, considering this time wasted.</p>

				<p class="paragraph-properties">A description of the signs of the zodiac would be incomplete without Aquarius. Born under the influence of Uranus and Saturn, people of this sign are naturally very emotional and have strong intuition. Aquarius is easy to hurt, because he is friendly and sensitive. It can be obtrusive, be tactless, therefore it repels people. Curious Aquarians love to learn new things, but are too superficial to become experts. A touch of romance prevents Aquarius from looking at the world soberly. But it does not interfere with being bright, extraordinary. Of the professions, this sign chooses those where you can show erudition, love charity, know how to remain calm even in a stressful situation.</p>

				<p class="paragraph-properties">Pisces is considered a passive sign, because they are under the influence of the planet Neptune and belong to the water signs. They have a lot of feelings and emotions, Pisces is drawn to mysticism, everything unusual. They have a well-developed intuition and understanding of other people, they like to dream. Some sentimentality makes representatives of this sign vulnerable. But in communication, Pisces are easy, pleasant, have a good sense of humor. In everyday life they are unpretentious, balanced, able to hide feelings and often manipulate other people. Vanity and commercialism are not inherent in the water sign, they know how to work, but do not strive for fame. Zodiac signs differ in temperaments, characters, innate talents and the ability to adapt to life. Each has its pros and cons, the main thing is to be able to see and feel them.</p>
